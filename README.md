# About me
Hello,ðŸ‘‹  

Welcome to my github! 

I am excited to share with you everything I know about data analysis. ðŸ§š 

#
I began my journey as a data analyst with SQL during the pandemic. Before that, while working in a scientific lab, I was already performing data analysis and visualization using Excel and other tools. In science, decisions are driven by data collected from experiments.

What excites me most about working with data is the ability to extract valuable insights and use them to guide business decisions. I also enjoy the vast and complex nature of the field. Most importantly, I love being a data pioneerâ€”sharing best practices and my knowledge with others!
